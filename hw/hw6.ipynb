    "# Problem 1: Cascade Gene Regulation  \n",
    "(Adapted from [Alon] Problem 1.4) Cascades: Consider a cascade of three activators, $X$ → $Y$ → $Z$. Protein $X$ is initially present in the cell in its inactive form. The input signal of $X$, $u_X$, appears at time $t = 0$. As a result, $X$ rapidly becomes active and binds the promoter of gene $Y$, so that protein $Y$ starts to be produced at rate $\\beta$. When $Y$ levels exceed a threshold $K_y$, gene $Z$ begins to be transcribed. All proteins have the same degradation/dilution rate $\\alpha$. \n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Write a mathematical model to model the cascade phenomena described above. You may model the system by describing the rate of change of protein concentrations. \n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Simulate your model in (a) by choosing biologically relevant parameters. What is the concentration of protein $Z$ as a function of time? \n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Compute the response time of $Z$ with respect to the time of addition of $u_X$? Discuss how you can improve the speed of the response of this system by changing parameters. To compare the response times for different parameter settings, normalize the steady-state to show a fair comparison of the response time. \n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Assume that you have a repressor cascade instead of an activation cascade. How do your conclusions change for parts (a) - (c)."

    "# Problem 3: Autorepression Speeds Up Response\n",
    "\n",
    "A paper published in 2002 showed that autorepression speeds up the response times of transcription networks in cells. We discussed the autorepression mechanisms in Week 4 and Week 5. In your simulations for HW 4, you could observe that the autorepression shows faster response when compared to unregulated gene expression. The goal of this problem is to use a similar mathematical model to analytically reason about the response time. Read the paper:\n",
